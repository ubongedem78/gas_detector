## Introduction

This project aims to create a gas detection system that provides real-time monitoring of gas levels. It uses an Arduino, GSM module for communication, gas sensor to detect gas levels, and an OLED display for user feedback.

## Components

- Arduino (Nano or other compatible boards)
- GSM Module (e.g., SIM800L)
- Gas Sensor (e.g., MQ series)
- OLED Display
- Buzzer
- ESP8266 (optional, for WiFi connectivity)

## Setup

1. Connect the components according to the provided wiring diagram.
2. Upload the Arduino sketch to your board.
3. Power on the system and wait for the gas sensor to warm up.

## Usage

- The gas sensor data is displayed on the OLED screen.
- If gas levels exceed a threshold, it sends an SMS alert to the specified phone number.
- Gas sensor data is uploaded to ThingSpeak for remote monitoring.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the wiring connections.
2. Verify that the gas sensor is properly warmed up.
3. Ensure that the GSM module is connected and has a valid SIM card.
4. Monitor the serial output for debugging information.
